sdesc: "Multimedia player and encoder"
ldesc: "MPlayer can play most standard video formats out of the box and 
almost all others with the help of external codecs. MPlayer currently 
works best from the command line, but visual feedback for many functions 
is available from its onscreen status display (OSD), which is also used 
for displaying subtitles. MPlayer also has a GUI with skin support and 
several unofficial alternative graphical frontends are available.

MEncoder is a command line video encoder for advanced users that can be
built from the MPlayer source tree. An unofficial graphical frontend
exists but is not included."
